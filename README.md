This quick and dirty repo should help devs to test V2 off-chain resolvers with ease, providing a hardhat instance and the required infrastracture to get up and running.

This repo consists in the [off-chain resover template](https://github.com/gelatodigital/off-chain-resolver-template) as well as a hardhat folder with a contract called Lock.sol. This contract locks an amount for a one year. We have created a method calle "unLock()" that will be called by Gelato OPS, when certain conditions off chain happen.


A short refresher about Gelato:
- execData is the execution payload in bytes that Gelato will execute in our case, the unlock() method
- exexAddress, the address of the deployed contract 
- canExec, boolean returned by gelato resolver/off chain resolver when calling the cheker method and tells Gelato to execute or not

# üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Quick Start


## Contract deployment

### 1) Add the env keys required 

```bash
INFURA_ID=INFURA_KEY
CHAINID=31337
RPC_URL=http://localhost:8545
PK=YOUR KEY
```
You need to input our private key (testing) nad the infure_Key for the forking Goerli. Change the values in .env-example file and rename it to .env
  &nbsp;  
### 2) : We open a separate terminal and create a local forked goerli 
```javascript
npm run fork
```

### 3) : We  compile our contract
```javascript
npm run compile
```


### 4) : We deploy our contract
```javascript
npm run deploy:contract
```
It is worth noticing that the deploy script copy the execData defined into the resolver folder for later building our resolver assembly module

```javascript
  let execData = lock.interface.encodeFunctionData(
    "resolverUnLock"
  );
  writeFileSync(join(process.cwd(),"../resolver/src/contract/execData.ts"),`export const  execData = "${execData}";`)

```
**RECAP**: so far we have created the contract that we want gelato to execute when the "off chain resolver" met certain conditions. After that, we will have to create the off-chain resolver assembly module.

## Resolver module

### 5) : Generate the module types
```javascript
npm run codegen
```

### 6) : Build your module
Remember that docker must run in your computer, if not the module wouln't be able to be built
```javascript
npm run build
```

### 6) : deploy to IPFS your module
Remember that docker must run in your computer, if not the module wouln't be able to be built
```javascript
npm run deploy:resolver
```

**RECAP**: In this part we have created our resolver assembly module and uploaded to ipfs. Great!, this module can be already consumed by everyone! (under the hood we use polywrapp for creating the assemble module)
